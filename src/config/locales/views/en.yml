          title: 'What is Phonics?'
          first_line_description: "Phonics is a rule that refers to a sound and a spelling."
          second_line_description: "Spelling is involved with letters such as 'a' and 'b'. "
          third_line_description: "If the rule is about your mother tongue, you will learn it unconsciously."
          fourth_line_description: "For example, if you have a Japanese friend, ask this question; how to pronounce 'あ'?"
          fifth_line_description: "The answers should be same."
          sixth_line_description: "That's because Japanese know the rules about Japanese sound and spelling. English has such rules as well. "
          seventh_line_description: "That is Phonics!! "
        second_subtitle:
          title: 'Do you teach Phonics in your school?'
          first_line_description: "Maybe most of you, English teachers from foreign countries, have experienced phonics."
          second_line_description: "However, most of the Japanese English learners don't."
          third_line_description: "While English education in Japan is gradually changing, Japanese teachers put focus on accuracy too much without learning phonics."
          fourth_line_description: "Japanese students don't learn spelling in elementary school. When they become a junior high school student, mistakes about spellings and grammars are not allowed."
          fifth_line_description: "If their production is not perfect, their score in test will be deducted. How about your school?"
        third_subtitle:
          title: 'What is PhonicsTrainer?'
          first_line_description: "For Japanese students learning English, it is important to notice the rules regarding phonics."
          second_line_description: "When they are around twelve(10 ~ 13), they should learn phonics with a lot of fun!! "
          third_line_description: "それに役立つのが、「PhonicsTrainer」です!!"
          fourth_line_description: "「PhonicsTrainer」では、ゲーム感覚で楽しく学べます!"
